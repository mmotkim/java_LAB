Due to transition from coding offline in the uni's LAB pcs to coding on our own pc/laptops, the allowed online work tasks have been reduced substantially, WorkerManager was one of them. Thus, WorkerManager development has been discontinued. 
This code is now for reference only.

If you're looking for File references, you should consider TaskManager.
